**hey, I'm Gideon, and I make things.** usually websites, but other stuff too!

some of those things are pretty cool:
- [a webring](https://github.com/heygideon/page-ring) for personal sites of teens in Hack Club
- [a website](https://github.com/youthacks/site-v3) for Youthacks hackathons
- [a system](https://github.com/heygideon/rpi-prescription) for ordering + collecting prescriptions using lockers

I have other hobbies too - you should go check out my website to see more about me!
